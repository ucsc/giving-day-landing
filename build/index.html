      <li><strong>Elephant seals: Weighing the Weanlings</strong>
      <p>The Año Nuevo Natural Reserve is home to nearly 10,000 northern elephant seals who travel thousands of miles each year. They congregate back at Año Nuevo, where up to 2,000 pups are born each winter.  To better understand how long they live and navigate in the open ocean we have created a “weanling weighing” team. The team will take body measurements, tag, and weigh 300 weaned pups (weanlings) and monitor their health throughout their lives.  This research is part of the Coastal Sustainabily initiative in the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz.</p> </li>
